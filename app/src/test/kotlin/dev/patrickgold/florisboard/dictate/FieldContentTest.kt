/**
 * What the floating button is allowed to assume about a field before rewriting it (issue #314).
 *
 * The bug this exists for: an empty Telegram or WhatsApp field hands out its placeholder ("Message",
 * "Ask Meta AI or Search") as if it were content, and reports no caret. `ACTION_SET_TEXT` sends the
 * whole field back, so the placeholder was written in as real text ahead of the dictation.
 *
 * The rule is therefore lopsided in the other direction from [DictateAccessibilityService.insertLandedFrom]:
 * **only proven content may be rebuilt, and a refusal proves nothing.** Reading "unknown" as "empty"
 * would be the worse bug — it deletes what the user wrote.
 *
 * This path cannot be exercised from an instrumented test (Android will not bind an accessibility
 * service into a process under instrumentation), so the decision lives here as a pure function.
