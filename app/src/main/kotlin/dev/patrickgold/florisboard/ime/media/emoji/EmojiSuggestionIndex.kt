/**
 * Word → emoji, derived from the CLDR annotations the app already ships (issue #338).
 *
 * The point of building this rather than shipping a curated word list: `assets/ime/media/emoji/
 * annotations/` holds **50 languages**, ~1900 emoji each, and the file for the active locale is parsed
 * at preload anyway. Inverting it costs one more pass over data already in memory, and the feature
 * starts in every one of those languages at once instead of in English with 49 translation debts.
 *
 * Inverting it *naively* is a trap, though, and the trap is worth writing down: CLDR keywords never
 * repeat the emoji's own name, so a keyword-only index answers `pizza` with 🍄 (the brown mushroom
 * lists "pizza"), `fire` with ❤️‍🔥 and `heart` with 💘. The name has to be indexed too — and then the
 * *names* bring their own noise, because they are descriptions: "face with tears of joy" would make
 * `with` and `face` fire, "rolling on the floor laughing" would make `the` fire.
 *
 * Three rules answer all of that, and none of them knows what language it is looking at:
 *
 *  1. **The whole name always counts.** `pizza` → 🍕 is never in doubt.
 *  2. **A name contributes single words only when it is short** ([NAME_TOKEN_LIMIT] tokens or fewer).
 *     Descriptive names are exactly the long ones, so this one rule silences `the`, `with`, `and`,
 *     `of`, `that` in English, `auf`, `mit`, `und`, `der` in German and `में` in Hindi — measured, not
 *     assumed — while "red heart" still contributes `heart`.
 *  3. **A keyword counts only if it is specific**, i.e. it belongs to at most [KEYWORD_EMOJI_LIMIT]
 *     emoji. This is what drops the category words that survive rule 2 because they *are* short names:
 *     `flag` (274 emoji), `face` (163), `animal` (122), `hand` (58).
 *
 * What no CLDR file can answer is which of several matching emoji people actually use — and that
 * question is language-independent: deciding once that ❤️ beats 💘 for the concept "heart" settles it
 * for `herz` and `दिल` too, because they land on the same emoji. Hence [PRIORITY], which is both the
 * filter (nothing outside it is ever suggested — this is what stops 🍄) and the tie-break.
