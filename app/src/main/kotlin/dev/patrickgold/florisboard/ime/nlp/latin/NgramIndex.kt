/**
 * A word-context table — `"w1 w2" -> count` or `"w1 w2 w3" -> count` — held as one flat blob and
 * binary-searched (issue #334).
 *
 * ### Why not a HashMap
 *
 * The bigram table used to be a `HashMap<String, Long>`, which is the obvious thing and was fine at
 * 60,000 entries. Two things stop being fine when the tables grow to the sizes the measurement chose
 * (150k bigrams + 100k trigrams per language):
 *
 * * **Memory.** Every entry costs a `String` object, a boxed `Long` and a hash node. Here the keys
 *   stay in the bytes they were read as, and the only per-entry cost is three ints. Measured by
 *   [NgramMemoryTest] on the shipped English table: the 150k bigrams cost **5.25 MB** as an index
 *   against **15.48 MB** as a map — and against **6.39 MB** for the 60k map that used to ship, so
 *   two and a half times the data now costs less than the small table did. Both tables together come
 *   to 8.54 MB, which is 34 % more than that old single table rather than the same; the saving is
 *   real but it is not free.
 * * **Prefix lookup.** Next-word prediction needs "every continuation of these words", and against a
 *   map that is a scan of all 60,000 keys on every prediction point. Sorted, it is a binary search
 *   for the range and a walk of the handful of entries inside it.
 *
 * ### The blob
 *
 * [blob] is the file's own UTF-8 bytes, unmodified: `key\tcount\n` per line. [lineStart] holds n+1
 * offsets and [keyEnd] the offset of each line's tab, so a key is `blob[lineStart[i] until keyEnd[i]]`
 * and needs no object until somebody asks for it.
 *
 * **Comparison is on UTF-8 bytes, not on `String`.** That is not an implementation detail: UTF-8 byte
 * order is code-point order, which is what the generator's Python sort produces, while Kotlin's
 * `String.compareTo` compares UTF-16 code units and disagrees above the BMP. Comparing the bytes is
 * what makes "the file arrives sorted" true rather than nearly true.
 *
 * Files are written key-sorted by `tools/glide-dict/ngramcount.py`, so loading is a linear scan. A
 * file that is *not* sorted — one of the old count-ordered bigram files still on a device, or any
 * file whose keys were folded on the way in ([DictFold.foldKey] can reorder and even collide them) —
 * is detected during that scan and sorted then, so correctness never depends on the file being right.
