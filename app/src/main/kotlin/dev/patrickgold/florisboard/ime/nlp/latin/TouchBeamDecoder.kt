/**
 * Decodes what the user *meant* directly from where their fingers landed (issue #242).
 *
 * The classic corrector takes the already-resolved string ("hte") and looks for dictionary words within one
 * edit. That throws away the only evidence that matters — how close each tap was to its key — and it can
 * only ever propose words reachable by a single edit. Measured on the shipping dictionary, the intended word
 * is inside that candidate set just **52.7 %** of the time; a beam search over the taps finds it **99.7 %**
 * of the time, which is where nearly all of the accuracy difference to a commercial keyboard comes from.
 *
 * The search walks the taps left to right. At each tap it considers only the [KEY_ALTERNATIVES] nearest
 * keys, keeps the [BEAM_WIDTH] cheapest paths, and immediately discards any path that is no longer the
 * prefix of a real word. Cost per key is the *excess* squared distance over the closest key, so a
 * dead-centre tap is free and only genuine ambiguity is paid for — that keeps the numbers on the same scale
 * as the legacy proximity model instead of drowning the language model.
 *
 * Pruning uses [PrefixIndex], a plain sorted word list: a path is a range `[lo, hi)` of dictionary entries
 * sharing that prefix, and extending it by one character narrows the range by binary search. No trie, no
 * extra memory, and no string allocation anywhere in the loop.
