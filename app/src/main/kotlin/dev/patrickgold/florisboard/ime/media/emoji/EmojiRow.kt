 * **The order is frozen while the row is on screen.** The content is read once per input session and
 * then left alone, even though tapping an emoji does update the history underneath. Re-sorting live
 * would move the emoji that was just tapped to the front — under the finger — so a second tap would
 * insert a different one. The emoji panel made the same call for the same reason (`remember`, with the
 * comment "prevents rapid emoji changes for the user"). Freshness is not lost: opening the emoji panel
 * unmounts this whole layout, so coming back re-reads, and so does moving to another field.
 *
 * The one exception is the long-press popup (issue #394): pinning or removing an emoji there is a change
 * the user asked for, and a row that went on showing the removed emoji would look as if nothing had
 * happened. Removal is also the opposite of the tap problem — the list shrinks away from the finger
 * instead of reshuffling under it.
