 * database mirrors Android's `UserDictionary.Words` schema exactly — [SystemUserDictionaryDatabase]
 * implements the same DAO against the system provider — and putting something foreign in it would break
 * the symmetry the two share. Keeping them apart also means "forget everything you learned" is one file
 * deleted, and that the user's own hand-curated list carries no migration risk from this feature.
 *
 * The two stores meet exactly once: when a word reaches [WordLearningGate.SIGHTINGS_FOR_PROMOTION] it is
 * copied into the personal dictionary and [promoted] is set here, so the row survives as the record of
 * *why* that entry exists and can be un-promoted again if the user deletes it.
