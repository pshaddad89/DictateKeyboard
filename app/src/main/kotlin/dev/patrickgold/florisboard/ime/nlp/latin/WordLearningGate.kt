/**
 * Whether a word the user just finished may be remembered, and what a remembered word is allowed to do
 * (issue #318).
 *
 * ### The problem this exists to solve
 *
 * A keyboard that remembers what you type is only useful if it remembers the right things. The failure
 * mode is not "learns too little" — it is a typo that gets learned, becomes a known word, and is
 * therefore never corrected again. That one cements itself: the more often autocorrect leaves it alone,
 * the more often it is typed, the more firmly it sits in the vocabulary.
 *
 * So the decision is split in two. **Whether to count a sighting at all** is this object's [shouldLearn],
 * deliberately strict. **What a word may do once counted** is the ladder in [Stage], deliberately slow:
 *
 * | sightings | may appear in the strip | protects itself from autocorrect |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | 1 · [Stage.REMEMBERED] | no | no |
 * | 2 · [Stage.SUGGESTED]  | yes, marked, never auto-committed | no |
 * | 3 · [Stage.PROMOTED]   | yes — it is now an ordinary personal-dictionary entry | yes |
 *
 * The shape is the one AOSP's `UserHistoryDictionary` has (its `isValidWord()` answers *false* for
 * everything it holds; only promotion into the personal dictionary makes a word valid), reached
 * independently and for the reason above rather than copied. What is genuinely ours is the entry test:
 * this keyboard records where the fingers landed (issue #242), so it can ask a question no
 * dictionary-only learner can — *did this look like a slip?*
 *
 * ### Why the tap evidence is the important gate
 *
 * Every other condition below is bookkeeping: the right field, the right origin, a plausible shape. The
 * one that separates "a name the dictionary does not know" from "a word the finger got wrong" is
 * [looksLikeASlip], which weighs the same tap evidence the corrector weighs — at a deliberately more
 * suspicious threshold, because refusing to remember something is cheap and rewriting it is not.

     *    This sees a finger that landed one key over — the ordinary slip — and is worth more than any
     *    amount of dictionary reasoning, because it is evidence about *this* typing rather than about
     *    the language.

     * evidence on short words, and where there is no tap evidence there is nothing to drown out.
     *
