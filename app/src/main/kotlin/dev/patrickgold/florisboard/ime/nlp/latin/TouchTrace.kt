/**
 * Where the finger actually landed for each character of the word currently being composed (issue #242).
 *
 * The keyboard resolves every tap to its nearest key and then throws the coordinate away, which is exactly
 * the information the autocorrect needs: "n" tapped dead-centre and "n" tapped halfway towards "m" are the
 * same character but very different evidence. This object keeps that evidence for the composing word so
 * [TouchBeamDecoder] can decode from the taps instead of from the already-resolved string.
 *
 * **The trace is self-validating.** [pointsFor] hands out coordinates only if the recorded characters still
 * spell the word the caller is asking about. Anything that desyncs the two — pasting, moving the cursor, a
 * hardware keyboard, a glide commit, text arriving from dictation — simply yields null and the caller falls
 * back to the classic edit-distance path. That is far more robust than trying to hook every such site.
 *
 * Written from the UI thread (touch handling), read from a background coroutine (suggestion generation),
 * hence the synchronization.
