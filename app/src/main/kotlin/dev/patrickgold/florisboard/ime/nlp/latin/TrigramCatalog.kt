/**
 * One downloadable per-language trigram file (`<lang>_trigrams.txt`) — the second word of context for
 * next-word prediction (issue #334). Same `"w1 w2 w3" -> count` shape as the bigram tables, downloaded
 * and removed alongside them, and read through the same [NgramIndex].
 *
 * ### Why a separate tier rather than simply more bigrams
 *
 * Measured on held-out text in two languages: after a function word — "the", "to", "of", which is
 * where 46 % of all predictions are asked for — **five times as many bigram rows are worth exactly
 * nothing**, 20.4 % → 20.4 % top-3 in English and 15.9 % → 15.9 % in German. Those pairs are all in
 * the table already; the only thing that adds information there is a second word of context, which
 * buys 4.6 pp (en) and 3.5 pp (de). The converse also holds: after a rare word this tier is worth
 * almost nothing and only more bigram rows help. The two are complements, and shipping either alone
 * leaves half the gap open — which is why the bigram tables grew to 150k in the same change.
 *
 * 100k entries rather than the 250k the issue suggests, because the gain saturates early: 50k already
 * buys 4.0 of the 5.3 points available after a function word, 100k buys 4.6, and the last 0.7 costs
 * two and a half times the bytes — bytes that are worth more spent on bigram rows.
 *
 * **Nothing here reaches the corrector.** These tables only ever add candidates to the strip, which the
 * user has to tap; the context term in `bigramContextScore` still sees one word. Re-ranking a *silent*
 * replacement on corpus context was measured to mangle 2.4–9.2 % of correctly typed words, and the
 * harness that would have to clear a deeper model has no running text in it at all.
 *
 * English is not bundled: unlike the bigram table, which the corrector also reads and which therefore
 * has to be there on the first keystroke after install, this one only improves suggestions and can
 * arrive later. Data is generated from the Leipzig Corpora Collection (wortschatz-leipzig.de, CC BY) by
 * `tools/glide-dict/generate_ngrams.py`; paste the script-printed catalog line here after uploading the
 * files as assets of the release named below.
