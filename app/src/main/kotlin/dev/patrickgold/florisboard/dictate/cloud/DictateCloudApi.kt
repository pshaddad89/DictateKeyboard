/**

 * a new device.
 *
 * Only these three endpoints live here. Dictation and rewording deliberately do not — the server
 * speaks the ordinary OpenAI formats for those, so they run through `OpenAiCompatibleClient` like
 * every other provider, with the wallet token in place of an API key.
 *
 * Nothing here decides anything about credit. The app cannot grant itself minutes, and a reply that
 * says otherwise changes nothing upstream: every request is metered where the money is.
