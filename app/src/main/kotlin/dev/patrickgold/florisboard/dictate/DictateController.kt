/**
 * Orchestrates the dictation flow that fuses the recording, the provider layer and the editor: tap
 * to record, tap again to transcribe the audio and commit the result into the focused text field.
 *
 * Provider, API key and model are read from the unified JetPref store (`prefs.dictate`), which is
 * seeded once from the legacy Dictate settings on first run (see [dev.patrickgold.florisboard.
 * dictate.data.prefs.DictateLegacyMigrator]) and is editable in the in-app Dictate settings screen.
 *
 * Ported comfort features (all toggleable in the Dictate settings): pause/resume, cancel, audio
 * focus (pause other apps while recording), optional Bluetooth-SCO mic and a transcription retry
 * with a visible indicator.
 *
 * Rewording (GPT) is wired in: [applyPrompt] runs a prompt on the selection/cursor, [startLivePrompt]
 * sends a spoken instruction to the model, and every transcription runs through [postProcessTranscript]
 * (auto-formatting + auto-apply prompts). The prompt chips that drive these come later (UI phase).
 *
 * Not yet ported from the legacy service (later refinement): usage tracking.
