 * Ported 1:1 from the original Dictate `PromptModel` so the on-disk representation in
 * `prompts.db` stays identical (see [PromptsDatabaseHelper] and `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`).
 *
 * [Serializable] so the prompt list can be exported to / imported from a Backup & Restore
 * archive as JSON (see `BackupScreen`/`RestoreScreen`).
 *
 * Special synthetic ids used by the keyboard UI (never persisted):
 *  - [ID_INSTANT_PROMPT]  (-1) live/instant prompt button
 *  - [ID_ADD_PROMPT]      (-2) "add new prompt" button
 *  - [ID_SELECT_ALL]      (-3) "select all / deselect" toggle button
