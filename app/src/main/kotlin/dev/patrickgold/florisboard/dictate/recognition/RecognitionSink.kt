import dev.patrickgold.florisboard.dictate.DictationSink

/**
 * [DictationSink] for the system voice-input path (issue #67). There is no text field to write into —
 * the finished transcript is accumulated and handed back to the OS through the active
 * [DictateRecognitionService] callback, which lets the calling app/keyboard insert it natively.
 *
 * Only text output is meaningful here; the field-reading methods return empty and the editing/enter
 * methods are no-ops. A live preview ([setDictationPreview]) maps to interim `partialResults` (used only
 * if a streaming path is ever wired up — the recognition path currently records in plain batch mode).
