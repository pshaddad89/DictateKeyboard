/**
 * "Share → Dictate" for stickers (issue #280).
 *
 * This is the answer to *"can I get my WhatsApp stickers in here"*, and it is the only answer that
 * holds across apps. Reading another app's sticker collection off the disk does not work in general:
 * Samsung's keyboard keeps its stickers in private app storage that no other app may read, Telegram
 * keeps its in a cache, and since Android 11 the file picker refuses `Android/data` outright. What
 * every one of them does offer is the share sheet, and what arrives through it is a plain image.
 *
 * So: long-press the sticker in the other app, share it here, and it lands in the folder. No UI of its
 * own beyond a toast — a screen would only be in the way of a two-second action.
