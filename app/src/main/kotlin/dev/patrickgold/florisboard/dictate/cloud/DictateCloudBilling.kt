/**
 * A coroutine-shaped wrapper around Google Play Billing, kept deliberately thin: it connects, lists
 * the packs, starts a purchase, reports what came back and consumes. It knows nothing about credit —
 * what a purchase is worth is decided by the server, and the two never meet in this file.
 *
 * One instance covers one errand and is then closed. Billing connections are cheap next to how
 * rarely this runs (a purchase, or one sweep at startup), and a short-lived client removes a whole
 * class of questions about stale state and reconnection.
 *
 * Requires Billing 8 or newer, which Play makes mandatory for uploads from 31.08.2026. Two things
 * changed there that shape the code below: purchase results arrive through [QueryProductDetailsResult]
 * rather than a bare list, and a one-time product can no longer be bought without an **offer token**
 * taken from its purchase option — passing none is rejected outright.
