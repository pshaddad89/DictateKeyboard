/**
 * A single prompt from the community prompt library (issue #105).
 *
 * This is a superset of the user-facing [PromptModel]: it carries the same four fields Dictate
 * persists in `prompts.db` (name/prompt/requiresSelection/autoApply) plus browse-only metadata
 * ([id], [category], [language], [author], [description]) that never gets written to the database.
 *
 * The on-the-wire shape is the library JSON hosted on the project's own repository (see
 * [PromptLibraryCatalog]); it is intentionally a strict extension of the prompt export format
 * (`{"version":1,"prompts":[…]}`) so an exported user file could be dropped straight into the library
 * with only metadata added.
