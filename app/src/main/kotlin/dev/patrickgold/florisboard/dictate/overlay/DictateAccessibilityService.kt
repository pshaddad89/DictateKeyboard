/**
 * Optional accessibility service that powers the floating dictation button (issue #88). It does two
 * things the keyboard cannot do from outside an active IME:
 *
 *  1. **Detect** when an editable text field holds input focus in *any* app, so the floating button can
 *     appear only when there is somewhere to dictate into ([editableFocused]).
 *  2. **Inject** the transcribed text into that focused field ([injectText]) — the equivalent of the
 *     IME's `commitText`, but driven from the overlay where no InputConnection exists.
 *
 * The service is entirely opt-in: it does nothing until the user enables both the floating-button
 * feature and this service in the system accessibility settings. It only ever reads the *focused*
 * field (to know it is editable and to place text at the cursor); it does not collect screen content.
 *
 * It also owns the floating bubble ([DictateBubbleController]) and promotes itself to a microphone
 * foreground service while a bubble-driven dictation records, so background mic capture is allowed.
