/**
 * Dictate Cloud, from the app's side: buying a pack, turning purchases into credit, and keeping the
 * balance somewhere the settings can read it.
 *
 * The order of operations here is the whole point of the file, so it is worth stating plainly:
 *
 *  1. Play takes the money and hands back a purchase token.
 *  2. The server is asked to redeem it. It checks with Google, grants the minutes and acknowledges.
 *  3. Only then is the purchase **consumed**, which is what lets the same pack be bought again.
 *
 * Nothing is consumed before credit is granted. A purchase that Play still lists as owned is the
 * only durable record that money changed hands, so it stays until it has become minutes — every
 * failure in between costs a retry rather than the purchase. [redeemPending] is that retry, and
 * redemption is idempotent server-side precisely so it can be called as often as needed.
