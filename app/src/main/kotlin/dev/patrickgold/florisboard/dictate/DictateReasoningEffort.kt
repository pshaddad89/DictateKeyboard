 * How much a reasoning model should "think" on rewording/command chat calls (issue #141), mapped to the
 * OpenAI-compatible `reasoning_effort` field. [OFF] omits the field entirely — the provider default is
 * used and non-reasoning models are unaffected. Applies only to chat/rewording, never to transcription.
 *
 * A prompt may override the global setting per-prompt (issue #155); [Serializable] so such an override
 * can ride along in exported/backed-up prompts.
