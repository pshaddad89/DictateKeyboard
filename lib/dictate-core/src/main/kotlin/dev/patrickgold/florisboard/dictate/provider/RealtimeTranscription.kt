 * Streaming (real-time) speech-to-text capability (issue #128), the live counterpart to the one-shot
 * [TranscriptionProvider]. Instead of uploading a finished file and awaiting one result, the caller opens
 * a session, pushes microphone PCM as it is captured, and receives interim + final transcript pieces over
 * a WebSocket. Every supporting provider (OpenAI realtime, Soniox, Deepgram, AssemblyAI, ElevenLabs,
 * Gemini Live, Mistral Voxtral) reduces to this same shape; only the wire framing differs per provider.
 *
 * A provider client may implement this alongside [TranscriptionProvider]/[LlmProvider]; the dictation
 * engine uses the streaming path only when the user has real-time mode on AND the selected provider
 * supports it, otherwise it falls back to the batch [TranscriptionProvider].
