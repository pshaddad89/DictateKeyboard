/**
 * Data residency (issue #403): which address an account actually talks to, and — the part that made this
 * more than a base URL field — whether the streaming host moves with it.
 *
 * The failure this guards against does not look like a failure. A region that moved only the REST host
 * would go on streaming to the default region while every batch request honoured the user's choice, and
 * nothing on screen would say so.
