/**
 * Asking Google again about what a sale was worth.
 *
 * Google answers two different questions on two different clocks. What the buyer paid is known the
 * moment the purchase completes; what reaches the developer is worked out once the payment settles,
 * and until then the order simply carries no revenue figure at all. The redemption path asks in the
 * same breath as the sale, so it almost always asks too early — which is fine, as long as somebody
 * asks again.
 *
 * Nobody did. The first real sale therefore sat in the ledger reading 0,00 € earned, indefinitely,
 * and every view believed it. This is the second ask: hourly, bounded, and recording each attempt
 * so a purchase nobody could get an answer for never looks like one nobody asked about.
 */

/**
 * How long to keep asking before treating the silence as final.
 *
 * Two weeks is well past any settlement delay. Beyond that the answer is not late, it is absent —
 * a permission missing on the service account, an order Google will not hand over — and repeating
 * the request for ever would only hide that behind a number that never arrives. The watchdog
 * reports what stays open (see `notify/rules.ts`).
 *
 * Measured against the sale itself, not counted in attempts. It used to be a count of fourteen,
 * which meant a fortnight only for as long as this ran once a night: asking every hour would have
 * spent the entire allowance before the first day was out, and a settlement that genuinely takes
 * three days would have been given up on after fourteen hours. The attempts are still counted —
 * they are the record of what was asked — they are simply no longer the clock.
