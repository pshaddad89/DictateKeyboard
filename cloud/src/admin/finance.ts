 * Play pays out (it keeps a share). So the takings come from Google's Orders API, stored per
 * purchase, and the spend comes from OpenAI's own cost endpoint.

 * towards the profit and a sale in francs was quietly worth nothing. Each purchase now carries the
 * ECB rate of the day it happened, written once and never recomputed — so the total is a sum of
 * fixed figures rather than a number that moves with the market. It is still an estimate against
 * Google's payout, which converts at Google's own rate, and every view says so.
 *
 * **Test purchases are excluded everywhere.** A licence tester's order carries the nominal price
 * with zero tax and zero revenue: counted in, it inflates the order count and drags every average
 * down. Counted separately instead.
